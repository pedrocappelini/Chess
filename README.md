# ♟️ Chess

A simple chess game made entirely in Java, using **Swing** for handling the graphics.  
All the artwork was created using **Aseprite**.

> 💡 Although this project uses Maven, no dependencies have been added so far.

## 🛠️ TODO

- ✅ **Check and Checkmate Logic**  
  Currently, the player can move while in check and even capture the opponent’s king.  
  Logic needs to be implemented to detect check, checkmate, and trigger game over.

- 🎨 **UI Improvements**  
  - Quality-of-life enhancements (hovering, highlights, move suggestions, etc.)  
  - Game menu and improved visual polish  
  - Multiple art themes (e.g., light/dark modes or classic/modern styles)

- 📊 **Material Bar / Captured Pieces Tracker**  
  - Show which pieces were taken during the match  
  - Optionally display material advantage

- 🤖 **Bot Opponent**  
  - Implement an AI to play against, either random or minimax-based

- 🔄 **Board Flip (Local Multiplayer)**  
  - Flip the board when switching turns to support two players locally

- 🧹 **General Code Optimizations**  
  - Refactor and clean up logic where needed  
  - Improve naming, modularity, and reduce duplication

## 🧰 Requirements
